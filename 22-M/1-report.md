# Failed transfer with low level call won't revert

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-08-sentiment-andyfeili/blob/96338b720493bc6dcbfa8ed24b75af53adc7900d/protocol/src/core/Account.sol#L149-L156

## Vulnerability Detail

An account can call an arbitrary contract using the `exec()` function. The function should return success True if transaction was successful, false otherwise. 

However low level calls (call, delegate call and static call) return success if the called contract doesnâ€™t exist (not deployed or destructed). This could result in the call failing, however success will be set to true, which means the call will not revert but fail silently.

## Recommendation

Add validation to target address

```solidity
require(0 != address(target).code.length)
```
