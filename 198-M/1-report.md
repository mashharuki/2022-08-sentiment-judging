# Not up to date documentation

## Summary
The 'Controller Facade' page of the docs (https://docs.sentiment.xyz/protocol/controllers/controllerFacade) mentions the
'canCallBatch' function, but their is no such function within the code.
 A Commit was found: "fix: remove canCallbatch (#19)", from 06/23/22, where the function canCallBatch was removed from the code but the docs were not updated, which leads to confusion.
